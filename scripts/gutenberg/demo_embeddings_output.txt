WHAT ARE EMBEDDINGS?
----------------------------------------------------------------------
An embedding is a list of 384 numbers that represents the 'meaning'
of a text in mathematical space.

Example for 'Don Quixote':
  First 5 numbers: [0.04445763677358627, 0.04999871551990509, -0.022923748940229416, -0.049006469547748566, -0.06087655574083328]
  Total numbers: 384

Books with similar themes/content will have similar numbers!
This lets us find books by MEANING, not just keywords.
